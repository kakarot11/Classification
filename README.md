# Supervised Learning Classification with multiple models.
Performed Linear Regression tasks on a specific dataset.
# Dataset
-
FLOW
1: One-hot encoding - changing the datatype of target variable
2: Visualization (Plotting histograms)
3: Training, Validation and Test datasets distribution.
4: kNN Implementation - Accuracy = 0.82
5: Naive Bayes - Accuracy = 0.73
6: Logistic Regression - Accuracy = 0.79
7: Support Vector Machine - Accuracy = 0.86
8: Plotting histograms between
  a) Loss vs Validation Loss
  b) Accuracy vs Validation accuracy
9: Neural Network
  a) Trained the model
    defined number of nodes - [16, 32, 64]
    defined dropout layer - [0 , 0.2]
    defined learning rate - [0.01, 0.005, 0.001]
    defined batch size - [32, 64, 128]
    defined epochs - 100
  b) Compiled the model using Optimizer Adam with loss (Binaric Crossentropy) and metrics (Accuracy)
  c) Finally assigned the validation loss with the least model loss if it is less then lest model loss
  d) Accuracy
